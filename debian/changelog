afni (0.20130821~dfsg.1-1) neurodebian; urgency=low

  * Fresh upstream snapshot
    - bulk of changes for graph datasets support
    - @DO.example could now be used in automated mode without interaction
      with users (-auto_test)
  * debian/control
    - recommend afni-atlases
  * debian/patches
    - cmake_sharedlibs:
      - do not bother with -D*_STAND_ALONE -- not used by upstream since a while
      - fix building of inspec, quickspec, CreateIcosahedron, MapIcosahedron
      - drop binaries not provided by upstream: SUMA_FreeSurfer,
        SUMA_SureFit, SUMA_Ply_Read, SUMA_Map_SurfacetoSurface, ShowCmap --
        their functionality is within the library and exposed by other binaries

afni (0.20121123~dfsg.1-2) neurodebian; urgency=low

  * Add afni-dbg package to provide debug symbols
  * debian/patches:
    - up_3rd_no_RefreshHTML_AtEvent -- to not even mention
      RefreshHTML from the patched XmHTML
    - up_condition_dset_unload -- avoid dereferencing NULL
    - cmake_sharedlibs:
      - link against lib3DEdge after libSUMA, since otherwise
        binaries do not get linked against it on Ubuntu systems
      - no need to manually extend list of libraries for
        SUMA_Map_SurfacetoSurface since it is added to the
        PROGRAMS and they are all linked against SUMA_LIBS
  * debian/rules:
    - since we --allow-shlib-undefined (because of the plugins)
      added a primitive check for few SUMA commands that they link
      against SUMA and 3DEdge libraries

  [ Alex Waite ]
  * New upstream code. Updated CMake build system.

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Upstream introduced circular dependencies between the internal libraries,
    hence linking is now done with --allow-shlib-undefined.
  * Added get-orig-source target to debian/rules.

  * Added patch to let @FindAfniDsetPath also search AFNI_TTATLAS_DATASET -- a
    configuration setting that is supported by thd_ttatlas_query.c and used by

afni (0.20101018~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. Added 3dDTtoDWI tool.
  * Switch build-dependency from lesstif2 to openmotif. Because openmotif is
    non-free AFNI is now a 'contrib' package. This move was necessary,
    because AFNI doesn't play nicely with lesstif (segfaults). Upstream
    doesn't want to support lesstif, because it is currently unmaintained.
  * Added build-dependency x11proto-print-dev to ease backporting to Debian
    lenny.
