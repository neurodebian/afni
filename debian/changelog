afni (0.20101018~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream code. Added 3dDTtoDWI tool.
  * Switch build-dependency from lesstif2 to openmotif. Because openmotif is
    non-free AFNI is now a 'contrib' package. This move was necessary,
    because AFNI doesn't play nicely with lesstif (segfaults). Upstream
    doesn't want to support lesstif, because it is currently unmaintained.
  * Added build-dependency x11proto-print-dev to ease backporting to Debian
    lenny.
