afni (0.20130830~dfsg.1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * debian/patches:
    - cmake_sharedlibs
      - add SUMA_gts_insert.c to libSUMAGTS and link SurfMesh against it
      - absorb librickr into libmri -- upstream dropped separate librickr
        as of 0.20080129~dfsg.1.
      - absorb libafni_warp into libmri -- upstream does "the same" and
        if split -- there is a circular dependency between afni_warp and
        mri forbidding robust building/linking
      - link lib3DEdge against m, and segtools and tracktools against mri
      - make SEGTOOLS_LIBS list only segtools
      - enforce --no-as-needed ld flag while building segtools due to libgsl
        not linking against libgslcblas thus failing to build with --as-needed
        which is defauilt on Ubuntus
    - cmake_tests
      - disable 3dedge test requiring data (waiting on upstream)
      - xvfb-driver -- allow to specify # of errors expected, so we
        could already test @DO.examples which should have 1 error
        on exit
  * debian/rules:
    - remove explicit -Wl,--allow-shlib-undefined which was introduced
      awaiting for a fix to #624156 long RIP.
    - add -Wl,--no-undefined for exe and shared linker flags
    - do not ignore tests failures

      with users (-auto_test)
  * debian/control
    - recommend afni-atlases
  * debian/rules
    - explicitly include hardening.make and adjust LDFLAGS and CFLAGS
      instead of relying on "magic" of DEB_BUILD_HARDENING which seems to
      not play with ccache nicely all the times.  Also exclude -fPIE since
      conflicts with -fPIC when gcc < 4.8
  * debian/patches
    - cmake_sharedlibs:
      - do not bother with -D*_STAND_ALONE -- not used by upstream since a while
      - fix building of inspec, quickspec, CreateIcosahedron, MapIcosahedron
      - drop binaries not provided by upstream: SUMA_FreeSurfer,
        SUMA_SureFit, SUMA_Ply_Read, SUMA_Map_SurfacetoSurface, ShowCmap --
        their functionality is within the library and exposed by other binaries
      - add zcross.c functionality to lib3dedge
      - minor typos
    - cmake_tests:
      - initiated collecting rudimentary tests
    - deb_path_to_doexamples:
      - find .do examples on Debian installations among docs
      - exit with code 1 if those could not be found
    - debian_paths:
      - search for images in SUMA_LoadImageNIDOnel under reasonable for images
        locations instead of PATH.  Fixed 'funstuff' paths in demo*.niml.do files.
      - specify path to READMEs to be under /usr/share/doc/afni-common

      RefreshHTML from the patched XmHTML
    - up_condition_dset_unload -- avoid dereferencing NULL
    - cmake_sharedlibs:
      - link against lib3DEdge after libSUMA, since otherwise
        binaries do not get linked against it on Ubuntu systems
      - no need to manually extend list of libraries for
        SUMA_Map_SurfacetoSurface since it is added to the
        PROGRAMS and they are all linked against SUMA_LIBS
  * debian/rules:
    - since we --allow-shlib-undefined (because of the plugins)
      added a primitive check for few SUMA commands that they link
      against SUMA and 3DEdge libraries
