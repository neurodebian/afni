afni for Debian
---------------

In comparison to the binaries distributed by the AFNI developers the Debian
version of AFNI is lacking some features, due to the restrictive licensing
of some of its dependencies. This concerns the following tools:

* 3dsvm and the associated plugin -- the required litesvm source code is
    covered by a non-free (non-commercial) license and has been removed from
    the Debian package.


Matlab support
--------------

AFNI's Matlab library is available at /usr/share/matlab/site/m/afni. To be able
to use it with Matlab one needs to add this path to Matlab's search path.

Unfortunately, the current code is not compatible with Octave.
