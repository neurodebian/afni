afni for Debian
---------------

In comparision to the binaries distributed by the AFNI developers the Debian
version of AFNI is lacking some features, due to the restrictive licensing
of some of its dependencies. This concerns the following tools:

* 3dsvm and the associated plugin -- the required litesvm source code is
    covered by a non-free (non-commercial) license and has been removed from
    the Debian package.

* 3dedge, 3dedge3 -- depend on lib3dedge, and the corresponding license even
    forbids distribution of its source code. Hence, the library sources have
    been removed and all tools depending on it are not available.

    This change requires some commandline options to be specified for tools
    employing skull stripping, since by default they would run 3dedge-related
    functions. Please see the afni(1) manpage for more information.
