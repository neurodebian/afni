Testing
=======
* 3DEdge comes with some basic tests, would be nice to build/execute

  require data files to be provided
  see http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/read.php?1,142220,142220#msg-142220

* Failed to open plugin /usr/lib/afni/plugins/plug_retroicor.so -- /usr/lib/afni/plugins/plug_retroicor.so: undefined symbol: RIC_CalcVoxelMeans

* Test using crafted and stock AFNI scripts

 - if we get AFNI_data6, we could excercise @DriveAfni simply by
   overloading prompt_user

    echo -e "#\!/bin/sh\nsleep 1\necho 1\n" >| prompt_user; chmod a+x prompt_user
    PATH=$PWD:$PATH @DriveAfni

   the only catch that it also shows a resultant image which needs to
   be closed somehow...
