3rd party stuff to modularize/patch away
========================================

- libgifti which we build (also see below in checks) is not included
   in any package since "installed" "system-wide" under usr/ prefix,
   not usr/lib/afni/

Additional components
=====================
- discoraj -- all the shiny stuff from Justin (seems to be just a INSTALL(DIRECTORY))


Checks
=====

- if we did "install" the lib_RetroTS under bin/
- we use provided upstream CMakeList for gifti but they don't use it,
   but introduced changes to the makefile to include nifti2_io and
   znzlib.
  So we might need to tune up that Cmake file

Duplicate files
===============
  eispack.h eispack/eispack.h
  coxplot.h coxplot/coxplot.h

Permissions
===========


Additional optional dependencies
================================

Testing
=======
* 3DEdge comes with some basic tests, would be nice to build/execute

  require data files to be provided
  see http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/read.php?1,142220,142220#msg-142220

* Test using crafted and stock AFNI scripts

 - if we get AFNI_data6, we could excercise @DriveAfni simply by
   overloading prompt_user

    echo -e "#\!/bin/sh\nsleep 1\necho 1\n" >| prompt_user; chmod a+x prompt_user
    PATH=$PWD:$PATH @DriveAfni

   the only catch that it also shows a resultant image which needs to
   be closed somehow...

Missing installations
=====================

scan_niml_vals.csh , CA_EZ_atlas.csh - missing from source distribution

Incorrect paths
===============
