  - 3dedge library is now released under GPL v3.0 license, thus it is no
    longer stripped out and all related functionality in AFNI should
    operate normally.

  - AFNI is now built with OpenMP support and where implemented would
    utilize all available CPU cores.  "man afni" for more details
