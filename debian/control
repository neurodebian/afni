Description: toolkit for analyzing and visualizing functional MRI data
 AFNI is an environment for processing and displaying functional MRI data.
 It provides a complete analysis toolchain, including 3D cortical surface
 models, and mapping of volumetric data (SUMA).
 .
 In addition to its own format, AFNI understands the NIfTI format and is
 therefore integrates easily with FSL and FreeSurfer.
