Driving AFNI from a Plugout
===========================
A plugout can control some aspects of AFNI.  This is done by passing a
command line of the form

  DRIVE_AFNI command arguments ...

to AFNI (once the plugout connection is open, of course).  The commands
available are described below.  The sample plugout plugout_drive.c can
be used to test how things work (highly recommended before you start
writing your own code).

RESCAN_THIS [c]
  rescans the current session directory for controller 'c', where 'c'
  is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E'.  If 'c' is absent, the 'A'
  controller's current session is scanned.  If the specified controller
  is not open, the acknowledgement from AFNI will be "BAD", otherwise
  it will be "good".

SET_SESSION [c.]directoryname
  Switches controller 'c' to be looking at the named directory.  The
  match on directory names is done by a sub-string match - that is,
  directoryname = "fred" will match an AFNI session directory named
  "wilhelm/frederick/von/guttenstein".

SET_ANATOMY [c.]prefix
  Switches controller 'c' to be looking at the anatomical dataset with
  the given prefix.  The prefix must be a perfect match - this is NOT
  a sub-string match.

SET_FUNCTION [c.]prefix
  Same, but for the functional dataset in controller 'c'.

OPEN_WINDOW [c].windowname [geom=+x+y]
  Opens a window from controller 'c'.  The window name can be one of
    axialimage sagittalimage coronalimage
    axialgraph sagittalgraph coronalgraph
  or can be a plugin, specified by something like
    plugin.Fourier_Stuff
  If geom=+x+y is present on the command line, then the window is positioned
  at the given location.

CLOSE_WINDOW [c].windowname
  Closes a window from controller 'c'.  You can only close graph and image
  viewer windows this way, not plugin windows.

QUIT
  AFNI will exit immediately.

============
The following commands are used to open graph windows and manipulate them.
At present there are two similar kinds of graphs:

  XY = connected (x,y) pairs - you must supply (x,y) for each new point
  1D = x increments by 1 each time, so you only give y for each new point;
       when x overflows past the right boundary, it wraps back to x=0.

Each graph can have multiple sub-graphs, which are stacked up vertically
with separate y axes and a common x axis (sub-graph #1 at the bottom, etc.).

Label strings in the graphs are interpreted in a TeX-like fashion.  In
particular, an underscore means to start a subscript and a circumflex means
to start a superscript.  Subscript or superscripts that are more than one
character long can be grouped using curly {braces}.

Greek letters and other special characters can be included using TeX-like
escapes. For example, "time (\Delta t=0.1)" might be a good label for the
x-axis of a 1D graph.  The full list of such escapes is

  \Plus      \Cross      \Diamond        \Box
  \FDiamond  \FBox       \FPlus          \FCross    \Burst    \Octagon
  \alpha     \beta       \gamma          \delta     \epsilon  \zeta
  \eta       \theta      \iota           \kappa     \lambda   \mu
  \nu        \xi         \omicron        \pi        \rho      \sigma

  \propto    \int        \times          \div       \approx   \partial
  \cap       \langle     \rangle         \ddagger   \pm
  \leq       \S          \hbar           \lambar
  \cup       \degree     \nabla          \downarrow
  \leftarrow \rightarrow \leftrightarrow \oint
  \in        \notin      \surd           \cents
  \bar       \exists     \geq            \forall
  \subset    \oplus      \otimes         \dagger
  \neq       \supset     \infty          \uparrow
  \{         \}          \\              \_         \?

All characters are drawn with line strokes from an internal font; standard
fonts (e.g., Helvetica) are not available.  If you want classier looking
graphs, find another program.

--------------------------

OPEN_GRAPH_XY gname toplab xbot xtop xlab ny ybot ytop ylab nam_1 .. nam_ny
  This opens a graph window for graphing non-MRI data.  Each graph window
  has a gname string; this lets you graph into more than one window.
  Other arguments are
    toplab = string to graph at top of graph              [empty]
    xbot   = numerical minimum of x-axis in graph         [0]
    xtop   = numerical maximum of x-axis in graph         [1]
    xlab   = string to graph below x-axis                 [empty]
    ny     = number of sub-graphs (all share same x-axis) [1]
    ybot   = numerical minimum of y-axis in graph         [0]
    ytop   = numerical maximum of y-axis in graph         [1]
    ylab   = string to graph to left of y-axis            [empty]
    nam_1  = name to plot at right of sub-graph 1, etc.   [not plotted]
  Arguments are separated by spaces.  If a label has a space in it, you can
  put the label inside "double" or 'single' quote characters.  If you don't
  want a particular label plotted, make it the empty string "" or ''.  If you
  don't want names plotted at the right of sub-graphs, stop the arguments at
  ylab.  Only the gname argument is strictly required - the other arguments
  have default values, which are given in [brackets] above.

CLOSE_GRAPH_XY gname
  Closes the graph window with the given name.

CLEAR_GRAPH_XY gname
  Clears the graph out of the given window (leaves the axes and labels).

ADDTO_GRAPH_xy gname x y_1 y_2 .. y_ny [repeat]
  Actually plots data into the given window.  In the i-th sub-graph, a line
  will be drawn connecting to (x,y_i), for i=1..ny.  You can put many sets
  of points on the line, subject to the limitation that a plugout command
  line cannot contain more than 64 Kbytes.

--------------------------

OPEN_GRAPH_1D gname toplab nx dx xlab ny ybot ytop ylab nam_1 .. nam_ny
  Opens a graph window that is set up to plot nx points across with spacing dx,
  in ny separate sub-graphs.  When the graph is full, the graph recycles back
  to the beginning.  The meaning and [default] values of parameters are:
    toplab = string to graph at top of graph              [empty]
    nx     = number of points along the x-axis            [500]
    dx     = spacing between x-axis points                [1]
    xlab   = string to graph below x-axis                 [empty]
    ny     = number of sub-graphs (all share same x-axis) [1]
    ybot   = numerical minimum of y-axis in graph         [0]
    ytop   = numerical maximum of y-axis in graph         [1]
    ylab   = string to graph to left of y-axis            [empty]
    nam_1  = name to plot at right of sub-graph 1, etc.   [not plotted]

CLOSE_GRAPH_1D gname
  Closes the graph window with the given name.

CLEAR_GRAPH_1D gname
  Clears the graph out of the given window (leaves the axes and labels).

ADDTO_GRAPH_1D gname y_1 y_2 .. y_ny [repeat]
  Actually plots data into the given window.  You can put many sets of ny
  values at a time on the command line, subject to the limitation that a
  plugout command line cannot contain more than 64 Kbytes.  Also, if you
  put more than nx sets of values, only the first nx will be plotted, since
  that will fill up the graph through one full cycle.

--------------------------

SET_GRAPH_GEOM gname geom=X-geometry-string
  This lets you move/resize a graph (1D or XY).  X-geometry-string is one
  of the forms:
    300x100         = set window size to 300 pixels wide, 100 high
    +50+90          = set window location to 50 pixels across, 90 down
    300x100+50+90   = set window size and location at the same time
